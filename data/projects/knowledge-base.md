The Knowledge Base is an effort by [SCESoc](https://www.scesoc.ca), the Systems and Computer Engineering Society in Carleton University. It is a repository of knowledge made by and for the peers at Carleton University.

Every year, several talented students with various experiences and knowledge get through the Systems and Computer Engineering Programs. This platform will act as a hub of knowledge for students to mutually share their learnings. This can include:

* Wikis on different topics/technologies
* Tutorials
* Challenges
* and more...

**Note:** All information on here must reflect the ethical guidelines set by Carleton University, including but not limited to:

* [The Academic Integrity](https://carleton.ca/registrar/academic-integrity/)
* [Equity and Inclusive Communities](https://carleton.ca/equity/)
* [Accessibility](https://carleton.ca/accessibility/)

## Getting Started

You can either go through the various topics or contribute by creating a new topic or enhancing an existing one. Here are some common guides that you can follow to make the best use of this platform based on your role.
